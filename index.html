        <p class="lead mb-4">About Me<br><br>

       I am currently a first generation college student majoring in media studies. When it came to determining what I wanted to accomplish with my life, social media marketing has always piqued my interest. I have always dreamed of working with brands and exhibiting my creativity through promoting products to the public. During the spring of 2021, I was given the opportunity to work with one of my favorite brands, Garnier, to promote their new Garnier Green Labs line. Despite the fact that it was not a compensated brand contract, I obtained valuable skills and useful marketing methods in the field. I went through the process of putting together an Instagram post, compiling a caption, and strategizing different Instagram stories to publish. I was given a contract that addressed every possible aspect in the postings of the products and the promotion of the brand itself. There were long pages of rules and violations. The company sent over post ideas and ways that would effectively cater towards the right audience. On Instagram, one of the most popular social media apps to this day, content creators are able to add certain tags to their posts. For example, I was able to tag that my posts were partnerships with the brand. That way, the audience on my account were informed of the advertising. Although my experience with Garnier was short, I became aware of the obligations and accountability I had while working in collaboration with a brand.<br><br>
       Social media has always been a universal way for people to communicate across seas, countries, and states. However, not only do social media platforms allow for communication, they are also one of the biggest marketing tools used to this day. Combined with physical and verbal marketing strategies, these platforms allow further creativity and audience outreach. Companies who grew into using these forms of media figure out unique and persuading ways to post about sales, upcoming launches, and many other things. That being said, marketing in social media allowed me the chance to creatively put out content for my audience and spread awareness on new and upcoming products and events. The advertising aspect of the involvement of businesses and companies was the most engaging and enjoyable experience. I got the chance to watch my imagination come together into a post or a story that was eventually put onto the internet. In addition, these social media posts were absorbed by my audience, and I had received their personal reviews on products that I posted about. Working with brands and companies that help support your growth in the career field is one of the most surreal experiences. There were so many helpful techniques and company associates that were kind enough to send out their personal favorite marketing techniques. Apps and websites that helped to enhance these photos and stories were immensely useful. The filters and editing of every piece of content that was created help an abundance of time and effort. Thus, although social media marketing is something that takes a lot of both, they outcomes are always worth it.
